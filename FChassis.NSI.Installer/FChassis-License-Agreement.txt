Part I - Master License Agreement (EULA)
Article 1 - Definitions
1.	Software 
Refers to the proprietary software application suite known as FChassis, a 
Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) system designed to generate G-code for 
machining operations such as cutting holes, cutouts, notches, and text embossing 
on automotive chassis components composed of twin C-brackets. 
The Software is designed for use exclusively with Dual Head Laser Cutting 
Machines (DHLCM) manufactured by Proteck Machineries Pvt. Ltd.. 
The generated G-code and its associated switch sets are unique to this machine. No 
warranty or assurance is provided for its functionality or safety on any other 
machine. 
?? Caution: Using the generated G-code on any unapproved machine may result in 
physical damage to the equipment, electrical components, or personal injury to the 
operator. 
The Software supports input in IGES (neutral data exchange), DXF (AutoCAD 
format), and CSV recipe formats (as defined by Teckinsoft Neuronics Pvt. Ltd.). 
It automatically detects notches, flex cuts, and cutouts for 4-axis dual laser tool 
cutting. The Software includes, but is not limited to, the main executable 
(FChassis.exe), supporting DLLs, configuration files, and documentation.
